# First Phaser App

This will be a platformer to test concepts and application of new rule sets in a new framework.

Things That I have learned so far:
sprites are complicated but cool when you get them working correctly. Each frame in the run cycle is accounted for and looped through. Newtonian physics are still cool especially when you can manipulate each parameter of them.

Things I want to learn to enhance the experience:
I want to learn how to take a large sprite sheet and take items directly from it and import them for texture, objects, etc
